# 🔐 RFID Smart Door Lock System

A secure and efficient smart door lock system powered by **Arduino Mega**, **RFID technology**, and a **servo motor**.  
This project scans RFID cards/tags to verify authorized access, unlocking the door for valid users and triggering an alert for unauthorized ones.

## 📋 Features
- ✅ **RFID Authentication** – Only authorized cards/tags can unlock the door.
- 🔄 **Automatic Lock/Unlock** using a servo motor.
- 🚨 **Buzzer Alert** for unauthorized access attempts.
- 💡 **LED Indicators** for status feedback:
  - Green = Access Granted
  - Red = Access Denied
- 🛠 **Customizable** for adding/removing authorized cards.

## 🛠 Components Used
| Component | Quantity |
|-----------|----------|
| Arduino Mega | 1 |
| RFID Reader (EM-18) | 1 |
| RFID Cards/Tags | 2 |
| Servo Motor (SG90) | 1 |
| Buzzer | 1 |
| LEDs (Red & Green) | 2 |
| Breadboard & Jumper Wires | As required |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The RFID reader scans the card/tag.
2. The Arduino compares the scanned ID with pre-stored IDs.
3. If the ID matches:
   - Servo unlocks the door.
   - Green LED lights up.
4. If the ID does not match:
   - Buzzer sounds.
   - Red LED lights up.
5. The servo automatically locks after a short delay.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage
1. Assemble the components according to the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino Mega.
3. Power up the system.
4. Scan an RFID card/tag:
   - If authorized → Door unlocks for a few seconds.
   - If unauthorized → Alert is triggered.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integrate **IoT** for remote door monitoring.
- Add a **keypad** for PIN-based entry.
- Store authorized IDs in **EEPROM** for persistence.

ðŸ¤– Ultrasonic Follower Robot
A smart robot that follows youâ€¦ but keeps a safe distance!
Built using Arduino and ultrasonic sensing, this bot mimics "personal space" â€” just like a polite friend.



ðŸš€ Features
Human Following Mode â€” Uses ultrasonic sensor to detect and follow objects in front of it.

Safe Distance Control â€” Automatically maintains a gap to avoid collisions.

Simple & Affordable â€” Built with basic, easily available components.

ðŸ›  Components Used
Component	Quantity	Description
Arduino Mega	1	Brain of the robot
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor	1	Detects distance to target
Motor Driver (L298N)	1	Controls motors
DC Motors + Wheels	2	For movement
Chassis	1	Robot frame
Jumper Wires	â€”	Connections

âš™ Working Principle
Ultrasonic Sensor measures the distance to the object in front.

Arduino processes the distance and sends signals to the motor driver.

If the target is too far â†’ robot moves forward.

If the target is too close â†’ robot stops or moves back.

ðŸŽ¯ How to Run
Connect all components as per the wiring diagram.

Upload the Ultrasonic_Follower.ino to Arduino Mega.

Power up the robot and place an object in front â€” watch it follow!

ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
Add obstacle avoidance for sideways movement.

Integrate with Bluetooth for remote control.

Make it follow specific people using Computer Vision.
